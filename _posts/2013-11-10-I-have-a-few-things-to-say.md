Welcome to my new home on the Internet and my first big open source project [Stacker](http://www.lokimeyburg.com/Stacker/). Jay-Z once said:
> Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it.

I love writing and I believe good rhetoric to be a person's most important skill - but until today, I think that quote by Jay-Z describes why I haven't posted anything online. I had bold opinions without my own personal anecdotes.

Now I've got a lot to share! A lot of bruises to show and advice on how you can avoid getting them. Also, I've got another side-project cooking and it should be done pretty soon.

Stay tuned...
