I'm humbled to be mentioned by the [Sauder School of Business](http://discoverwith.sauder.ubc.ca/en/power-to-do-good/the-meaning-of-work) for my work at [Medeo](http://www.medeo.ca). [Discover With Sauder](http://discoverwith.sauder.ubc.ca/en/power-to-do-good/the-meaning-of-work) is a publication that talks about the changing landscape of business - in particular the power to bring about positive change in the world.
