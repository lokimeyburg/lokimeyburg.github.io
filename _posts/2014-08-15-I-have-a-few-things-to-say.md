Welcome to my new home on the Internet and my first big open source project [Stacker](http://www.lokimeyburg.com/Stacker/). Jay-Z once said:
> Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it.

I think that quote by Jay-Z describes why I haven't posted anything online: I had bold opinions but lacked experience to back it up.

Now I've got a lot to share, a lot of bruises to show and a lot of advice on how you can avoid getting them. I love writing and I believe good rhetoric to be a person's most important skill.

Stay tuned...
