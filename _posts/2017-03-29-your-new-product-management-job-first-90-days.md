When you start a new product management job it can feel like you’re standing at the top of a ski run. It’s exhilarating, but also a little scary. You’re really hoping not to fall flat on your face.

The first 90 days are really important. It’s when you need to get up to speed, demonstrate your ability and garner the trust of your colleagues.

After that point you need to be on top of things – managing your product and delivering real value to your business.

But like a ski run, your first few months in a new job will be over far too quickly.

So to help you, I’ve provided this checklist of what you need to do in the first 90 days. Good luck!
