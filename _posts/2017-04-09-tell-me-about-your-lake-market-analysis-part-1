*Markets* are such a nebulous thing. *Markets* can feel like yet another business term (YABT™ ) that tries to *objectively* categorize something as *subjective* as “demand” or “people’s problems”*.* But that doesn’t mean it’s not an incredibly important idea! In fact, thinking in terms of *markets* has probably been one of the most important skills I’ve learned when I first started bringing new ideas and products to the masses that need them. The problem with “*market”* being such a vague term is that people talk about their own market with similar reckless imprecision.

When I used to teach Product Management, some students struggled to think in terms of *markets* - often they found the concept daunting and unfamiliar - so instead, I encouraged everyone to think and talk about their market as if though it was a fishing lake. *Markets* are vague - *lakes* are crystal clear! 

I love asking this question to any new entrepreneur: *“tell me about your lake and how you plan to fish from”*. To me (and hopefully to them) their lake is more important than *how* they’ve decided to go about catching the fish.


- How big is your lake?
- What’s the fish like?
- How do I get there?
- Who else fishes there? 
- Why haven’t more people found your lake?

When people talk about their market in terms of a lake, it’s easier for everyone involved because we can all picture a lake in our mind. It gets everyone on the same page when we now say *market*: it’s a place where there is a limited amount of fish(buyers) for people to catch. 

> Give me a giant market — always. My position has always been: you find a great market and you build multiple companies in that market. Our view has always, preferably, been: give us a technical problem, give us a big market when that technical problem is solved so we can sell lots and lots and lots of stuff. Do I like to do that with terrific people? Sure. Are we unwilling to invest in companies that don’t have them? Sure. We invested in Apple when Steve Jobs was about eighteen or nineteen years old — not only didn’t he go to Harvard Business School, he didn’t go to any school. — Don Valentine

Where green excited entrepreneurs get confused is when they think *demand* is the *market.* Demand, by itself, does not make a market: people wanting to pay money to solve a problem is an indication there *may* be a market, but 80 potential customers is *not* a market. Invest in big markets first (always) and then build a company (or two) around that market.

Here’s an example: your new fledgling product is beginning to grow. You’ve got 20 or so happy customers, all paying to use your minimum viable product and you’re signing up about 1 new customer per day from word of mouth alone. Are you onto something big? *Is it time to quit your day job and hire some developers?* Stop! Wait a second! *Tell me about your lake* We’ve all gone fishing before and caught some fish, but that doesn’t mean we’re going to pack up everything and move to the lake for a few years because the lake is clearly such a lucrative opportunity! You better be damn certain that that’s the lake you want to be fishing from for some time. To be clear: you’re not interested in catching 20 fish - that’s easy - you’re interested in catching thousands or millions of fish. Once you’ve found and analyzed your lake (size, number of fish, etc), then it’s just a matter of getting better at fishing *from* the lake (different approaches, more fisherman, new lures, etc).


## Your Lake (Market Analysis Basics)

Rule: You are never allowed to talk about your market vaguely or imprecisely. Yes, markets can be inexact, *but not yours!* You grok (verb: to understand something deeply, appreciate actively and profoundly) your market because you’ve defined it in one of the most detailed (and probably expensive) spreadsheet you’ve ever put together. 

In this example, let’s pretend that I’m building a scheduling app for family doctors. OK, even though I could sell (or fish) anywhere in the world, the reality is, we all have to start selling (fishing) in one location. So for now, let’s say I’m going to start selling in British Columbia, Canada. How many GPs are there in BC? Well, I could estimate the total number of doctors quite accurately using [various estimation techniques](https://www.cpsbc.ca/physician_search), but luckily the BC Government has a [directory of physicians](https://www.cpsbc.ca/physician_search) which I can scrape to get the complete list. The total is around ~5500 family doctors. So that’s the size of my lake. There are 5500 fish that I could catch.

Next, we want to get as much relevant information about each person on that list. My assumption is that family doctors that are young, with a professional website, in high-income areas are more likely to buy from me. In addition, my other hypothesis is that any doctor that’s 1 using a scheduling tool may be inclined to buy from me since they have had such a terrible experience with their current/old scheduling tool. All of these data points take time to get but is possible. I can use the [BC census data](http://globalnews.ca/news/370804/income-by-postal-code/) to determine the average income by postal code. I could use a tool like [Built With](https://builtwith.com/) to determine which (if any) scheduling tool is running on a family doctor’s website. You can also retrieve Yelp or other review scores to determine the customer friendliness of the clinic. You could put up a Craigslist ad and offer to pay someone $100 if they go through the list and mark everyone they think comes from Austria, Germany or Switzerland (where healthcare is of a very high quality and therefor they’d be more inclined to buy from me). Money spent doing this research is much less expensive than any kind of engineering work.

## Fishing Techniques (and Your Target Market) 

If you’ve ever gone fishing at a remote lake you’ll know that there’s always a trick (or two) that the locals share on how to best catch fish at that specific lake. Sparkly fishing lures in the morning on the east bank, fly-fishing at sunset on any shallow beach or maybe try floater for catching bigger fish from your boat. All of these methods work - some better than others - but we should go about trying to identify and score each method to estimate how many fish we expect to catch. We want to give each fish a score out 100 to determine the likelihood they’d buy from us given the criteria we’ve identified. The simplest way to do this is to list each criteria and give them a score that they contribute to the overall number or you can create more complex ways of scoring the list of candidates. 

**Here are 2 fishing tips we got from the locals:**

1. Fishing in daylight near shallow beaches 
2. Use floaters when it’s raining outside but stay on the east coast

Ok, now what about doing the same thing for our list if doctors? Below is a very simple example where I’m adding up values - one after another - but it can be much more complex if you allow it. For example: we can make it so that if the doctor does not have a website then we will automatically give them a score of 5% overall (because they can’t buy our online scheduling app anyway then). It helps to circulate the list of criteria to around 5-7 people who know the market well and ask them what percentages they might give certain criteria (and ask them why they think your suggestions were too high or too low). This will ensure your numbers/percentages are supported by a few more people’s experienced opinion. 

Here’s a very simple illustration on how we give a doctor a score  93 / 100:


https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_542E78D7C085F06BDC0AF4A4EEC70BB4426EB6E34FC4379B0546BEE43EC5A43D_1491995634031_Screen+Shot+2017-04-12+at+4.12.06+AM.png


If we wanted, we could’ve created a much more complex method to give each doctor a score. It really depends on how detailed you want to get, and how well you know the criteria you’ve identified as being important. Next, let ’s calculate the score of every doctor. Remember, the higher the score, the more likely we think they are to buy from us. 


- Scores between 85-100% are on the “they would be stupid not buy from us” list.
- Scores between 75-85% are also very good candidates and will most likely be won-over with a few minor tweaks here and there.  
  - Typically, I’ve found these two brackets of customer segments are the biggest contributor to my new product breaking even financially. (More on this in a later article).

Ok, so if the green and yellow sections (shown above) usually only get your money back (to break-even), then how do I everyone else below that? Ah, yes! Good question. There’s literally a book written about this very dilemma called [Crossing The Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=sr_1_1). Simply put, you’ve just discovered why it’s easy to get the Innovators (green) and Early Adopters (yellow) and now you’re wondering “who do I cross the chasm” and catch the rest of the fish in my pond. I highly recommend reading [Crossing The Chasm](https://www.amazon.com/Crossing-Chasm-3rd-Disruptive-Mainstream/dp/0062292986/ref=sr_1_1) to not only understand that 1) this is a very normal problem almost everyone faces in new product development and 2) crossing the chasm is like the Oregan Trail of startups: special arrangements need to made, it’s expensive and you might lose a few people on the way.

## So Long and Thanks For All The Fish (What’s next?)

In the next article, I’d like to continue the analogie of using fishing lakes to help determine your initial product investment cost (and your estimated return). Also what to do when other fisherman begin to show up, how to identify that a lake is about to run dry and finally, where to find your next lake.
