When I grew up in a military boarding school in South Africa you would never find a student without his pen and small notebook. That's because it was a punishable offence if a private officer did not have his pen or notebook with them - even while they were wearing civvies. The senior officers would use this fact to catch unlucky private officers in some very creative ways (like when I came back after a date with a girl from another school and obviously didn't take my notebook with me).

This also meant that we were taught a very simple method on how to use a notebook correctly. I'm surprised to see people have either neither heard of this method, or have the [most complex notebooks](http://becomeawritertoday.com/gtd-moleskine-notebook/) I've ever seen. If it involves sticky notes, then it's already too complex. (You can thank my wife for making me write this article because at first I thought it was too simple to justify writing about it). Here it is:

All of my notebook’s pages are numbered, and I always let the first four pages of my notebook be my Table of Contents. (I manually number my pages in big batches every now and then). I keep track of months in my Table of Contents so that I can quickly jump to a specific page number to find the beginning of that month. I also keep track of important notes like “ideas for new team structures" or “call with phone company about my order”. Basically, I put the page numbers of each month and other meaningful pages into my Table of Contents. It’s something I learned in cadets as the proper way to organize and use a notebook.

That's it! Just track your page numbers and maintain a Table of Contents. It's "just enough process" (I really like that idea).

Also, I have a reminder written in the beginning of my notebooks (just a habit I've built over the years, I guess). It should give you an idea of the purpose of the notebook.

> This notebook is my second brain.
> This notebook is how I work through problems in my head.
> This notebook is only for taking notes.
> This notebook is not where I manage my tasks.
> As soon as I have time, I should get actionable items out of my notebook and into the right place.

I've been paperless for seven years now - that includes books. (I'll be writing about being paperless and my minimalist lifestyle in the future). When I was rigidly paperless I used Evernote for note-taking and it was great! I loved being able to search through all my notes, view them on any device, share them with friends and most importantly I loved that I can see my notes back to 2010 and know that they're safe (unlike losing a notebook).

But after three years of using Evernote I went back to carrying around a notebook. Product Management is about problem solving, trying to understand big problems and navigating uncharted waters (I don't get paid to take notes). Nothing let's me chew on a problem the same way I can with pen and paper. "A problem well understood, is a problem half solved", right? I'd take clarity and solved problems over any of the benefits I used to get from using Evernote.
