To kick off the new year I decided to take my most popular blog post, [Product Management Articles and Books](/2016/09/23/product-management-articles-books.html), and turn it into a website called [Product Management Links](http://www.lokimeyburg.com/pmlinks/). It comes loaded with updated content for Product Managers and has been reorganized into four sections: Fundamentals, Planning, Building, Design and Career.

Please message me if you would like to see any links added to the collection. I will continue updating the website's design and content over the next few weeks.
