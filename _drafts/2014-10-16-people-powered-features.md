title:  "Managing Your Product Development Around Orthogonal Epics"

- Staying sane is the hardest thing to do
- Problems start clear and then quickly the details begin to set in and you become stressed
- People sometimes organize problems by skills (design, development) and not around the problem
    - Hard to visualize progress towards a single feature

<!--more-->
- Problems should be divided into orthogonal problem sets (epics)
- ..... talk about JIRA and managing around epics .....
    - Manage at the week and month level, not the day and week level
    - Epics should contain all the research discussions
    - Epics should be small so that you avoid having the scope reduced to meet deadlines (oh well I think we can ship without this)
    - Other than bug fixes or small wins, Epics should have a branch and that branch should get merged to master and beta users should test it for continuous feedback. Always get reference customers!
    - Epics should be all activities towards a goal, that includes marketing efforts and other product research related initiatives.
- Roadmapping!
    - Future features are not based on evidence (kind of made up)
    - Problems should be driven and prioritized by evidence (evidence in confluence > epics in Jira)
    - Linking research to epics
    - Big estimation meetings for high level tickets help give you an idea of level of effort for upcoming epics
        - Turn it into a day long party of estimating and breaking things up
        - This allows you to estimate the delivery of each epic based on number of tickets, total story points and average velocity
    - Ideally there's another view where quarters are split vertically and not horizontally but that doesn't really exist
- Manage at the right level and avoid burn out
    - I've seen product managers get burnt out running around with their head cut off.
    - If there are problems, it's probably more systemic and at the team size, competency, leadership or product market for level: not at the day to day product level (like not having the right Google Analytics setup)
    - Manage strategically at the month level, report at that level, plan at that level, hire at that level
- OKR to Epics
    - (This should probably be discussed earlier as an addendum because not everyone does OKRs)
    - Always had an issue translating customer problems into engineering requirements
    - Typically key results are rewritten (envisioned) by the engineering team to become epics. Often more than one epic achieves a key result but you usually want a one to one mapping.
        - Book a meeting to do this with the team
        - OKR software usually lets you map Epics to an Objective or KR
    - Team always alignment!
        - Why am I doing this ticket? How because of this Epic. Why are we doing this Epic? How because of this research! How does it compare to the company goals? Oh, because of this OKR!
